# Media Network Documentation

This repository contains documentation for the Media Network. It includes a set of markdown files that serve as the source for a static site generated using Docusaurus. 

## Installation and Running

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and Yarn installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    - Using HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/mediafoundation/media-docs.git`

2. Navigate into the repository directory: `cd media-docs`

3. Install the dependencies: `yarn install`
