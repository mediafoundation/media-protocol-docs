### Introduction

Media Network is a peer-to-peer (P2P) system designed to enable the creation of marketplaces underpinned by blockchain technology. These marketplaces emerge from a set of persistent, non-upgradable [smart contracts](/smart-contracts/overview) that emphasize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and operations without the intervention of restricting intermediaries.

These smart contracts have been [deployed](/smart-contracts/deployment-addresses) across various prominent blockchains and are poised to expand further. In doing so, Media Network aligns with the P2P nature of these underlying blockchains, cultivating a resilient and widespread network. Each instance, once ignited, operates indefinitely, contingent only on the continuous vitality of its base blockchain.

### How does Media Network compare to traditional platforms?

Understanding Media Network's unique essence compared to standard systems requires an exploration of two domains: the transition from centralized to peer-to-peer models and the distinctions between permissionless and permissioned architectures.

### Unleashing Marketplaces with Peer-to-Peer Power

Traditional marketplaces predominantly rely on centralized platforms where a singular entity oversees transactions, assures trust, and shapes the user journey, akin to prevalent online shopping venues.

Media Network pioneers an alternative approach, weaving marketplaces within a P2P fabric. Instead of an overarching authority, the protocol encourages direct interactions between individuals, endowing them with the freedom to craft and steer their personal marketplaces.

By sidelining intermediaries, this protocol ushers in a new era of marketplace democratization, pivoting from centralized governance to peer-to-peer empowerment.

### Embracing Permissionless Systems

Media Network's permissionless and unchangeable character sets it apart from mainstream platforms. These features are inspired by the foundational tenets of blockchain and our staunch allegiance to principles of open access and irrevocable operationsâ€”critical for a world where anyone, anywhere can spawn marketplaces without encountering bias or third-party threats.

This permissionless blueprint assures that the protocol remains open to all, devoid of barricades or selective limitations. Everyone has the liberty to establish, oversee, or engage in marketplaces as they see fit. This stands in stark contrast to older platforms that might impose access constraints.

Because the protocol is immutable, it stands unyielding and non-upgradable. No party can pause, roll back, or tweak the protocol's intrinsic functions. While there might be operational guidelines for specific marketplaces, the core protocol stays untouched, bestowing trust and consistency upon every user.

[^1]: Blockchain systems sometimes adopt a peer-to-contract paradigm. These closely mirror peer-to-peer structures but replace individual peers with unyielding, perpetual programs known as smart contracts.

:::note
Media Network is a P2P system anchored on public blockchains. Although its inception traces back to the Media Foundation, we wield no centralized sway or supremacy over it. Once activated, it sails autonomously, resistant to tweaks or interferences by its originators, the foundation, or any external entities. Always approach the smart contracts with diligence and informed caution.
