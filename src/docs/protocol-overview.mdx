### Introduction

Media Network is a peer-to-peer [^1] system crafted to enable the creation of decentralized marketplaces on the blockchain. The protocol is built as a set of persistent, non-upgradable [smart contracts](/smart-contracts/overview); developed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and function devoid of any intermediaries who may impose selective restrictions.

The protocol smart contracts are [deployed](/smart-contracts/deployment-addresses) on various recognized blockchains and will expand to new, reputable chains. This allows the protocol to match the decentralization of the underlying blockchain, providing a resilient and widespread network. Each Media Network instance, once activated, will run non-stop, depending only on the ongoing existence of the underlying blockchain.

### How does Media Network compare to typical platforms?
To fathom the distinctive nature of Media Network in comparison to regular frameworks, it's imperative to delve into two arenas: the shift from centralized  platforms to decentralized ones, and how permissionless systems differ from their permissioned counterparts.

### Decentralizing Marketplaces with Peer-to-Peer Power
Marketplaces traditionally operate on centralized platforms. In such setups, a single entity governs transactions, ensures trust, and dictates the user experience, reminiscent of many popular online shopping sites.

Media Network revolutionizes this model by introducing a decentralized framework. Rather than a centralized authority, this protocol facilitates peer-to-peer (P2P) interactions, granting individuals the autonomy to create and manage their own marketplaces.

By removing intermediaries, the protocol paves the way for a democratized marketplace landscape, transitioning from centralized dominance to peer-to-peer empowerment.

### Permissionless Systems
Another deviation from conventional platforms is Media Network's permissionless and immutable nature. These design choices are drawn from blockchain's foundational principles, and our unwavering commitment to the ethos of unrestricted access and unalterable operations as crucial for a future where anyone globally can establish marketplaces without facing discrimination or counter-party risks.

A permissionless architecture ensures that the protocol is fully accessible to the public without any barriers or selective restrictions. Anyone can create, manage, or participate in marketplaces at their discretion. This is a marked departure from traditional platforms that might limit access based on various criteria.

The protocol is immutable, meaning it is steadfast and non-upgradable. No individual or entity can halt, reverse, or modify the protocol's inherent functionalities. While there may be guiding principles for the operation of certain marketplaces, the core protocol remains unaffected, guaranteeing trust and reliability for all its users.

[^1]: Blockchain protocols are sometimes referred to as peer-to-contract systems as well. These are similar to a peer-to-peer systems, but with immutable, persistent programs known as smart contracts taking the place of a peer.

:::note
Media Network is a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that runs on public blockchains. While its inception can be credited to the Media Foundation, we hold no centralized control or dominance over it. After the protocol is activated, it functions autonomously. It's immune to alterations or interventions by its founders, the foundation, or any external party. Always be careful and well-informed when you interact with the smart contracts.
