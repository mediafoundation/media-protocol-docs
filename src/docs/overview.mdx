## Protocol, Media Foundation, Media Cloud
First, let's make clear the differences between the various parts of "Media Network", some of which may confuse new users.

- **Media Foundation:** This entity serves as the driving force behind the development of the Media Network protocol, along with Media Cloud.
- **Media Network Protocol:** A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create a protocol enabling anyone to build their own decentralized marketplace.
- **Media Cloud:** Built on the trustless foundation of Media Network, it presents a non-upgradable web services marketplace, setting a new decentralized standard to compete with platforms like Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.
- **Protocol Governance:** A governance system for the Media Network Protocol, enabled by the MEDIA token.
