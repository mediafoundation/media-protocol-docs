## Media Protocol, Media Network, Media Foundation
First, let's make clear the differences between the various parts of the **Media Protocol**, some of which may confuse new users.

- [Media Protocol](./protocol-overview): A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts forming a protocol that lets anyone create decentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces of any kind.

- [Media Network](https://www.media.network): Anchored in Media Protocol's trustless protocol. A decentralized web services marketplace, offering a peer-to-peer alternative to giants like Google Cloud & AWS.

- [Media Foundation](https://www.media.foundation/): This entity serves as the driving force behind the development of the Media Network protocol, along with Media Cloud.
