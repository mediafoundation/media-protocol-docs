## Media Network, Media Foundation, Media Cloud
First, let's make clear the differences between the various parts of the **Media Network Protocol**, some of which may confuse new users.

- [Media Network](./protocol-overview): A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create a protocol enabling anyone to build their own decentralized marketplace.

- [Media Cloud](https://www.mediacloud.ws/): Built on the trustless foundation of Media Network, it presents a web services marketplace, setting a new decentralized standard to compete with platforms like Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.

- [Media Foundation](https://www.media.foundation/): This entity serves as the driving force behind the development of the Media Network protocol, along with Media Cloud.
