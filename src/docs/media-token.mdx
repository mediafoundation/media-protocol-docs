**MEDIA** is the governance and utility token of Media Protocol & Media Network. In its **utility role**, MEDIA functions as a **medium of exchange between clients and providers**. In terms of **governance**, the protocol's decentralized nature, which ensures it is not controlled by a single entity, places oversight in the hands of a collective of individuals and entities. This democratic structure empowers **holders of the MEDIA token to wield it in casting votes** on decisions pertinent to the protocol.


### Exploring the Functions of MEDIA Token

The token has four pivotal roles: as a commitment from registered providers, as a payment tool for secure and transparent transactions, as a voice for MEDIA holders in the protocol's governance, and for treasury management.


### Commitment

To actively participate in the marketplaces, providers are required to stake LP MEDIA tokens. These tokens are produced by pairing MEDIA with a native coin, such as ETH, through liquidity provision for the MEDIA/ETH pair on Uniswap V2. By staking, providers gain the ability to initiate offers and engage with clients. This act of staking signifies their commitment, instilling confidence in clients and contributing to the protocol's long-term stability.

### Transactions

Providers set offers, pricing them in MEDIA tokens at their discretion. In response, clients allocate MEDIA tokens to secure these offers, leading to formalized deals. Billing hinges on both the duration of these deals and the agreed-upon rate. Once a deal concludes or is cancelled, tokens are disbursed to the provider based on the services delivered. Any unspent tokens revert to the client. This system ensures transactional fairness and efficiency.


### Governance

Using the MEDIA token, our community guides the direction of the Media Protocol. Through a self-managed organization, or DAO, the token holders can vote on decisions, helping to shape how the protocol grows and changes over time.
For a deeper dive, we recommend you to read through the [governance docs](/governance/overview).

### Treasury Management

The MEDIA token also plays a pivotal role in the financial mechanics of the system. Fees generated from transactions within the protocol are directed to a treasury. Holders of the MEDIA token have the capacity to decide on the allocation, usage, or distribution of these accumulated treasury funds. In essence, the MEDIA token acts both as a governance tool and a key to unlock and channel the protocol's financial reserves.
