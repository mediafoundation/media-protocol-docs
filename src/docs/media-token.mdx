**MEDIA** is the governance and utility token of the Media Network Protocol. In its **utility role**, MEDIA functions as a **medium of exchange between clients and providers**. In terms of **governance**, the protocol's decentralized nature, which ensures it is not controlled by a single entity, places oversight in the hands of a collective of individuals and entities. This democratic structure empowers **holders of the MEDIA token to wield it in casting votes** on decisions pertinent to the protocol.


### Exploring the Functions of MEDIA Token

The token has four pivotal roles: as a commitment from registered providers, as a payment tool for secure and transparent transactions, as a voice for MEDIA holders in the protocol's governance, and for treasury management.


### Commitment

Providers must stake LP MEDIA tokens (MEDIA paired with a Native Coin like ETH, created by providing liquidity in the MEDIA/ETH pair on Uniswap V2) to enable their participation in the marketplaces. They will then be able to create offers and interact with clients. This staking amount is for commitment purposes, providing clients a way to identify committed providers and ensuring the long-term self-sustainability of the protocol.

### Transactions

Providers create offers, setting prices in MEDIA tokens according to their own discretion. Clients lock up MEDIA tokens to pay for these offers, creating deals. Billing is determined by the length of the deals and the agreed rate. When a deal is completed or canceled, tokens are transferred to the provider in proportion to the services rendered, and any remaining balance is returned to the client. This process ensures fairness and smoothness in all transactions.

### Governance

Using the MEDIA token, our community guides the direction of the Media Network. Through a self-managed organization, or DAO, the token holders can vote on decisions, helping to shape how the protocol grows and changes over time.
For a deeper dive, we recommend you to read through the [governance docs](/governance/overview).

### Treasury Management

The MEDIA token also plays a pivotal role in the financial mechanics of the system. Fees generated from transactions within the protocol are directed to a treasury. Holders of the MEDIA token have the capacity to decide on the allocation, usage, or distribution of these accumulated treasury funds. In essence, the MEDIA token acts both as a governance tool and a key to unlock and channel the protocol's financial reserves.
