### What is the Media Network Token (MEDIA)?

The MEDIA token is Media Network Protocol's governance token. The protocol is not dominated by a singular entity; instead, a collective of individuals and entities oversees the leading protocol for creating decentralized marketplaces. Holders of the MEDIA token can wield it to cast votes on decisions pertinent to the protocol.

### Exploring the Functions of MEDIA Token

The token has three pivotal roles: as a payment tool for secure and transparent transactions, as a voice for MEDIA holders in the protocol's governance, and for treasury management.

### Transactions

In the protocol, the MEDIA token is central. Providers stake LP MEDIA tokens (MEDIA/Native Chain pair) to enter Media Cloud and transact with clients. Earnings are based on deal duration and agreed rate. Clients block MEDIA tokens to secure offers. On deal completion or cancellation, tokens shift proportionally to the provider, ensuring a balanced transaction process.

### Governance

Using the MEDIA token, our community directs Media Network via a DAO. This self-steering body taps into MEDIA tokens for voting, shaping the protocol's growth and evolution.

### Treasury Managment

The MEDIA token not only serves as the governance instrument for the Media Network Protocol but also plays a pivotal role in the financial mechanics of the system. Fees generated from transactions within the protocol are directed to a treasury. Holders of the MEDIA token have the capacity to decide on the allocation, usage, or distribution of these accumulated treasury funds. In essence, the MEDIA token acts both as a governance tool and a key to unlock and channel the protocol's financial reserves.
