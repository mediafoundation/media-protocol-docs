Media Protocol is a binary smart contract system comprised of many libraries, which together make the Core and Periphery.

The Core contracts provide fundamental safety guarantees for all parties interacting with the Media Protocol. It defines the logic of market initialization, provider management, deal management, and all the interactions involving the respective functionalities therein.

Periphery contracts interact with the Core contracts but are not part of the core. They are designed to provide methods of interacting with the core that increase clarity and user safety.

Externally available functions are all viewable in the reference documentation. Internal functions are viewable on the Marketplace Github repo.

# Core Contracts

## Marketplaces

| [Marketplaces Technical Reference](./core/marketplaces)

The Marketplaces smart contract is the core contract for the Media Protocol. Its capabilities include initializing new marketplaces, as well as creating, updating, and deleting providers, offers, and deals.

The contract provides a structured and secure environment for providers to list their offers and for consumers to engage with these offers by creating deals. With built-in management and transparency features, it ensures smooth operations while maintaining the trustless essence of a blockchain-based solution.

### Marketplaces Participants

- **Owners:** The initializers of the marketplaces instances. Owner are able to modify their marketplaces' parameters. Given the permissionless nature of the protocol, owners can't ban providers offers or deals, but these can be filtered in their UIs.
- **Providers:** Entities or individuals that offer specific services or goods in a marketplace.
- **Clients:** Entities or individuals that take offers for specific services or goods in a marketplace.

### Marketplace Management
Owners can perform the following operations on their initialized marketplaces:

- **Set marketFeeTo**: Sets the wallet receiving the fees generated by the marketplace.
- **Set marketFeeRate**: Sets the rate percentage of the fees generated by the marketplace (from 1% to 10%).
- **Set REQUIRED_STAKE**: Sets the required amount of LP MEDIA tokens required to become a provider.

### Provider Management

- **Register**: Anybody can register as a provider. It is required to stake MEDIA tokens to do so. The required amount is set by the Marketplace Owner.

- **Update settings**: Providers can update their details and staked amount of MEDIA.

- **Unregister**: Providers without current open deals can safely unregister and retrieve their MEDIA stake back.

### Offer Management
Offers are the specific goods or services that providers put forth in the marketplace. Providers can perform the following operations on the marketplaces they are registered:

- **Create Offers**: A provider can create an offer detailing what they are providing, its cost, and other essential information.
- **Updating an Offer**: Providers have the flexibility to adjust their offers based on changing circumstances or market demands.
- **Deleting an Offer**: Offers that are no longer available or valid can be removed by the provider.

### Deal Management
Deals represent the agreement between a provider and a client. Both providers and clients can perform operations to deals.

- **Creating a Deal**: Client selects offers deals are created, and if these offers are set to be auto-accepted, then the billing starts capturing the terms agreed upon.
- **Collecting a Deal**: Providers can collect the payments for the amount due by clients.
- **Cancelling a Deal**: In situations where a deal is no longer needed or has been finished, it can be canceled. If there's outstanding balance, it would be sent proportionally to both client and provider in relation to the time elapsed and price per second.
- **Deposit more balance**: Clients can deposit more MEDIA balance to deals to add more time for that specific deal if the deal is not set to single billing period.

## Other Features

- **Event Logging**: For traceability, the contract emits events when significant actions occur, like the creation or modification of providers, offers, or deals.
