The SDK provides abstractions to assist you with interacting with the Media Protocol smart contracts in a Typescript/Javascript environment (e.g. websites, node scripts). With the SDK, you can manipulate data that has been queried from the [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/).

To begin, we recommend looking at our [**Guides**](./guides/quick-start) which include runnable examples and walkthroughs of core usages. These guides will help you better understand how to use the SDK and integrate it into your application.

For complete documentation of the SDK's offerings, see the [**Technical Reference**](./reference/getting-started).
