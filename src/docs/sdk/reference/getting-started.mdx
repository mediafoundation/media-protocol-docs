The pages that follow contain technical reference information on the Media Protocol SDK. Looking for a [quick start](../guides/quick-start) instead? You may also want to jump into a [guide](../guides/fetching-deals), which offers a friendlier introduction to the SDK!

The SDK is written in TypeScript, has a robust test suite. The principal exports of the SDK are entities: classes that contain initialization and validation checks, necessary data fields, and helper functions.
