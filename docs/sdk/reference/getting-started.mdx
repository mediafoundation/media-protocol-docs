The pages that follow contain technical reference information on the Media Protocol SDK. Looking for a [quick start](../guides/quick-start) instead? You may also want to jump into a [guide](../guides/fetching-offers), which offers a friendlier introduction to the SDK!

Moreover, before reading this technical reference is highly recommended to read the [Media Protocol Overview](../overview) and the [Media Protocol Flow](/docs/flow.mdx) to understand the basics of the Media Protocol.

This section will cover in detailed the following topics:
 - Models: Every model will be explained in detail.
 - Types: Every export type will be explained in order to provide a better understanding of each return object.
