The pages that follow contain technical reference information on the Media Protocol SDK. Looking for a [quick start](../guides/quick-start) instead? You may also want to jump into a [guide](../guides/fetching-offers), which offers a friendlier introduction to the SDK!

The SDK is written in Javascript, but will be rewritten in Typescript in the near future. 

The main exports of the SDK are: `Sdk`, `Marketplace`, `MarketplaceViewer`, `MarketplaceHelper`, `Resources`.

## Code
