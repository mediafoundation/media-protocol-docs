The [Marketplace contract](/smart-contracts/reference/core/marketplace) is the core of the Media Protocol. It allows users to initialize new marketplaces, register as providers, create offers, take deals, and more. Through the SDK, users can make use of all the functions available in the contract in a Javascript enviroment. [Click here](/smart-contracts/reference/core/marketplace) to check the technical reference of the contract where you can find all the available functions.

## Examples

### Initialize a new marketplace
  
```javascript
// import the sdk
import { initSdk, config, Marketplace } from 'media-sdk';

// initialize the sdk using your mnemonic (you can also use a privateKey or viem walletClient)
initSdk({ mnemonic: 'your mnemonic phrase' });

// instanciate the marketplace contract
const marketplace = new Marketplace();

// initialize a new marketplace
const hash = await marketplace.initializeMarketplace({
  requiredStake: 100,  // replace with your required stake 
  marketFeeTo: config().walletClient.account.address, // replace with your market fee recipient address 
  marketFeeRate: 5 // replace with your market fee rate %
});

// wait for the transaction to be mined
const transaction = await config().publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt( 
  { hash: hash }
);

//get the id of the new marketplace from the transaction logs
console.log(transaction.logs[0].topics[1]);

```

// import the sdk
import { initSdk, Marketplace } from 'media-sdk';
