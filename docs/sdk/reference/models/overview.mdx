Every [Media Protocol Smart-Contract](/smart-contracts/overview) has a corresponding model in the SDK used to interact with the contracts in a more user-friendly way.
The following section will describe some common methods and properties that almost all models have.

## Common Properties

All models have a `config` property of type [SdkConfig] which is set when the model is instantiated.

## Common Methods

Both the `view` and `execute` methods require the following parameters:

- `functionName`: The name of the contract's function to call.
- `args`: An array of arguments to pass to the contract's function. They must be provided in the required order from the contract's function.

Although both functions are marked with a return of `Promise<any>`, they will return whatever the blockchain function returns. This could be a single value, an array, or an object.

### View

The view method is used to fetch the latest data from the blockchain. It is an asynchronous generic method that returns a `Promise<any>`.

```javascript
async view(functionName, args): Promise<any> {
    try {
        return await this.config.publicClient.readContract({
        address: ContractAddresses.Resources[this.config.publicClient.chain!.id],
        abi: ResourcesABI.abi,
        functionName: functionName,
        args: args,
      })
    } catch (error) {
        throw error
    }
}
```

### Execute

The execute function in used to send a transaction to the blockchain. It is an asynchronous generic method that returns a `Promise<any>`.

:::note
It **requires** that the given sdk to have been initialized either with a wallet client or a privateKey/mnemonic due to the need to sign the transaction.
:::
```javascript
async execute(functionName, args): Promise<any> {
    try {
      const { request } = await this.config.publicClient.simulateContract({
        address: ContractAddresses.Resources[this.config.publicClient.chain!.id],
        abi: ResourcesABI.abi,
        functionName: functionName,
        args: args,
        account: this.config.walletClient.account,
      })
      return await this.config.walletClient.writeContract(request)
    } catch (error) {
      throw error
    }
}
```

### Examples
The following example will create a deal and then retrieve it from the blockchain using the [Marketplace](/docs/sdk/reference/models/Marketplace.mdx) model.

```javascript

import { Sdk, Marketplace } from 'media-sdk'

const sdk = new Sdk({mnemonic: 'your mnemonic here'})

const marketplace = new Marketplace(sdk)

const marketplaceId = 1
const resourceId = 1
const offerId = 1
const blockedBalance = 100
const sharedKeyCopy = "Sample Shared Key"

// create a deal
await this.execute("createDeal", [
    marketplaceId,
    resourceId,
    offerId,
    blockedBalance,
    sharedKeyCopy
])

// retrieve the deal
const dealId = 1
let deal = await marketplace.view("getDealById", [marketplaceId, dealId])
```

## Further considerations

Although the SDK models provide a wide range of functionalities, there are some cases that using this functions to read/write directly over the Media Protocol Contracts might be useful.
It is highly recommended if you are going to do so, to read and have a strong understanding of the [Media Protocol Smart-Contracts](./smart-contracts/overview).
