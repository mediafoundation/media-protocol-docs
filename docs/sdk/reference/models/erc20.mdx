The `ERC20` class represents interactions with an ERC20 contract, providing methods to read from and write to the contract. It supports typical ERC20 operations such as balance checks, token transfers, and approvals.

## Class: ERC20

The `ERC20` class allows developers to interact with ERC20 smart contracts on the blockchain, providing functionality for reading contract data and executing transactions like transfers and approvals.

### Constructor

The constructor initializes an instance of the `ERC20` class.

#### Parameters

- `sdkInstance`: `Sdk`
An instance of the SDK containing configuration details for interacting with the blockchain.

#### Usage

```javascript
const erc20 = new ERC20(sdkInstance);
```

## Attributes

### `config`: `SdkConfig`

Contains the configuration for the SDK, which includes:

- `walletClient`: A client used for managing wallet-based blockchain transactions.
- `publicClient`: A client used for performing read-only interactions with the blockchain.

The `config` attribute holds essential information for interacting with both wallet-based and public (read-only) blockchain operations. It is initialized using an instance of the `Sdk` class and is used throughout the `ERC20` class to facilitate various contract interactions.


## Methods

### `view`

Reads data from the ERC20 contract.

- **Parameters**:
- `address`: `Address`
The address of the ERC20 contract.

- `functionName`: `string`
The name of the function to call.

- `args`: `any[]`
The arguments to pass to the function.

- **Returns**: `Promise<any>`
The result of the contract call.

- **Throws**:
Will throw an error if the contract call fails.

### `execute`

Executes a transaction on the ERC20 contract.

- **Parameters**:
- `address`: `Address`
The address of the ERC20 contract.

- `functionName`: `string`
The name of the function to call.

- `args`: `any[]`
The arguments to pass to the function.

- **Returns**: `Promise<any>`
The result of the transaction.

- **Throws**:
Will throw an error if the transaction fails.

### `balanceOf`

### `transferFrom`

Transfers tokens from one address to another.

- **Parameters**:
- `address`: `Address`
The address of the ERC20 contract.

- `from`: `Address`
