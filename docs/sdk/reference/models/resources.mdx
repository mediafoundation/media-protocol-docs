The `Resources` class is designed to interact with the Resources smart contract. It allows for reading data and executing transactions related to resources, such as adding, updating, and removing resources. This class utilizes the SDK configuration for managing public and wallet client interactions.

## Class: Resources

The `Resources` class provides methods to interact with the Resources smart contract, allowing developers to manage resources on the blockchain. It supports both read-only operations and state-changing transactions.

### Constructor

The constructor initializes an instance of the `Resources` class.

#### Parameters

- `sdkInstance`: `Sdk`
An instance of the SDK containing configuration details for interacting with the blockchain.

#### Throws

- **Error**: Will throw an error if the `Resources` contract address is not found for the current network ID.

#### Usage

```javascript
import { Resources } from "media-sdk";

const resources = new Resources(sdkInstance);
```

## Attributes

### `config`: `SdkConfig`

Contains the configuration for the SDK, which includes:

- **`walletClient`**: A client used for managing wallet-based blockchain transactions.
- **`publicClient`**: A client used for performing read-only interactions with the blockchain.

The `config` attribute is initialized using an instance of the `Sdk` class. It holds essential configuration details required for interacting with the Resources smart contract. By using this configuration, the `Resources` class ensures that all method calls are executed with the correct network and account settings, allowing for seamless interaction with the blockchain.
