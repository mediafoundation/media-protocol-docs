The Media Protocol SDK exists to help developers build on top of Media Protocol. It's designed to run in any environment that can execute JavaScript (think websites, node scripts, etc.). While simple enough to use in a hackathon project, it's also robust enough to power production applications.

## Installation

The easiest way to consume the SDK is via [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/media-sdk). To install it in your project, simply run `yarn add media-sdk` (or `npm install media-sdk`). 

## Usage

To run code from the SDK in your application, use an `import` or `require` statement, depending on which your environment supports. Note that the guides following this page will use ES6 syntax.

## ES6 (import)

```typescript
import { Sdk, MarketplaceViewer, Marketplace, Resources, Helper } from 'media-sdk';

```

## CommonJS (require)

```javascript
const { Sdk, MarketplaceViewer, Marketplace, Resources, Helper } = require('media-sdk');
```

## Reference

Comprehensive reference material for the SDK can be found [here](../reference/getting-started)
