The `RatingSystem` contract enables the management of the rating system for providers in any initialized marketplace. It allows clients to rate providers and retrieve the average rating for a provider.

## Structs

The `Rating` struct stores the sum of ratings and the count of ratings received by a provider.

```solidity
struct Rating {
    uint256 sum;
    uint256 count;
}
```
---

## State Variables

- `clientRatings`: This is a mapping that stores the ratings given by clients to providers. It maps the marketplace ID to the client's address and the provider's address to the rating value.
- `providerRatings`: This is a mapping that stores the ratings received by providers. It maps the marketplace ID to the provider's address and the `Rating` struct, which contains the sum of ratings and the count of ratings received.
