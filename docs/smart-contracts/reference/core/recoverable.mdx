This is a technical reference for the Media Protocol's ``Recoverable`` smart contract.

## Inheritance

The `Recoverable` contract inherits the Open Zeppelin's [`AccessControl`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#AccessControl)
 and [`IERC721Receiver`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver) contracts.

## Write Functions


### recoverNative

Allows the contract owner to recover native coins sent unintentionally to the contract.

```solidity
function recoverNative() external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) returns (bool);
```

Return:

| Type      |                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `bool`    | Whether the recovery was successful or not.        |

---

### _recoverERC20

Allows the contract owner to recover tokens sent unintentionally to the contract. It is an internal function. It is not meant to be called directly. To use this function, contracts that inherit from `Recoverable` should implement a public function that calls this function. In all our contracts, this function is called `recoverERC20`.

```solidity
function _recoverERC20(IERC20 _token) internal onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) returns (bool);
```

Parameters:

| Name             | Type     |                                                      |
|------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| _token           | `IERC20` | The token you want to recover.                       |

Return:

| Type      |                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `bool`    | Whether the recovery was successful or not.        |

### _recoverERC721

Allows the contract owner to recover ERC721 tokens sent unintentionally to the contract. It is an internal function. It is not meant to be called directly. To use this function, contracts that inherit from `Recoverable` should implement a public function that calls this function. In all our contracts, this function is called `recoverERC721`.

```solidity
function _recoverERC721(IERC721 _token, uint256 _tokenId) internal onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) returns (bool);
```

Parameters:

| Name             | Type     |                                           |
|------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| _token           | The token you want to recover.                       |
| _tokenId         | `uint256` | The token ID you want to recover.        |

Return:

| Type      |                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `bool`    | Whether the recovery was successful or not.        |


## Modifiers

Modifiers are used to conditionally change the behavior of functions. For instance, certain functions can only be executed by the contract owner or by authorized addresses.


### onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)

The `onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)` modifier ensures that `msg.sender` is an admin.
